        "# Homework 6: Neural Language Models\n",
        "\n",
        "## Total Points: 48+5\n",
        "- **Overview**: In this assginment, we’ll be moving on from traditional n-gram based language models to more advanced forms of language modeling using *neural networks*. Additionally, we will learn how to build a character-level recurrent neural network, known as a char-RNN for short, with a famous Python package - PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This assignment is divided into 2 sections:\n",
        "  1. Classify simple and hard words\n",
        "  2. Classify city names to country\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Following our instructions,  you will implement your own char-RNN, and learn how it can deal with classification problems.  \n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **FAQs:** Please look at the FAQ section before you start working:\n",
        "  - **How do I save a PyTorch model?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    After you trained your PyTorch model, the command below will save your model to the local directory. Please ensure that your model can be used for classification.\n",
        "```\n",
        "torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **How do I load a PyTorch model?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Use the command below.\n",
        "```\n",
        "model = RNN()\n",
        "model.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))\n",
        "model.eval() #To predict\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **How do I get started with PyTorch?**  \n",
        "\n",
        "    This assignment will give you a basic insight to PyTorch. For more details, please have a look at [this tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/linear-regression-in-x-minutes-using-pytorch-8eec49f6a0e2).  \n",
        "\n",
        "  - **How do I speed up training?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Although you have access to GPU with free account, you will have a better GPU if you use Google Colab Pro. To use GPU, send the model, input, and output tensors to the GPU using `.to(device)`. Refer [the PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html) for further information.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Why are some of the words mislabeled in the training and development datasets?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Noisy data is common when data is harvested automatically like [the cities dataset](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo). The onus is on the data scientist to ensure that their data is clean. However, for this assignment, you are not required to clean the dataset.\n",
        "  - **What if I disconnected from the session due to inactivity or maximum usage, and can't connect back again?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    If you subscribe to Google Colab Pro you will have longer session time and better access to GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Grading**: We will use the auto-grading system called `PennGrader`. To complete the homework assignment, you should implement anything marked with `#TODO` and run the cell with `#PennGrader` note. **There will be no hidden tests in this assignment.** In other words, you will know your score once you finish all the `#TODO` and run all the `#PennGrader` tests!\n",
