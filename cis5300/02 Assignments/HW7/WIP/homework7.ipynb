        "- **Overview**: In this assignment, we will explore how to take pre-trained language models and adapt them to do different natural language tasks. We'll cover:\n",
        "   - Applying models to down-stream tasks without extra training (15 points)\n",
        "   - Fine-tuning for sequence classification (20 points)\n",
        "   - Fine-tuning for sequence pair classification (25 points)\n",
        "   - Fine-tuning for token classification (40 points)\n",
        "- Deliverables: This assignment has several deliverables:\n",
        "   - Code (this notebook) (Automatic Graded)\n",
        "- Grading: We will use the auto-grading system called PennGrader. To complete the homework assignment, you should implement anything marked with #TODO and run the cell with #PennGrader note.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section we'll be training BERT for the same Sentiment Analysis task from Section 1. We'll start by giving a short introduction to the concept of fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What is fine-tuning?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained model to accomplish a particular down-stream task. This is typically done by swapping out the pre-trained model's last layer (its head) for a new randomly initialized head and training both model and head.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Model \"heads\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "The final output layer of a language model is typically called a \"head\". The standard head used by models when pre-training is called a \"language modeling head\". This is a dense linear layer that projects the $D_{enc}$ length encodings of each of the $L_{context}$ tokens to a probability distribution over the vocabulary. A single transformation matrix is learned and applied to all context tokens, which are treated as a batch dimension. The total size of this layer is thus ($D_{enc}$ x $|V|$).\n",
        "<!-- The head and the network are always trained *together*. We compute the cross-entropy loss $L = -\\log(P(w))$ using the output of the head and backpropagate through the head to the rest of the network. -->\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Adding on a \"Classification head\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Section 1 we used BERT's language modeling head to perform the Sentiment Analysis task. While we *can* train the model with its original LM head, this is unnecessary, as the LM head outputs probabilities over all tokens rather than just our targets. Thus, in this section we're going to remove the language modeling head and replace it with a classification head.\n",
        "\n",
        "A classification head is very similar to a language modeling head. It is a dense linear layer that projects the $D_{enc}$ length encodings of each of the $L_{context}$ tokens to a probability distribution over the *$n$ classes* rather than the whole vocabulary. The transformation matrix is again shared, with the context tokens treated as a batch dimension. The total size of this layer is thus ($D_{enc}$ x $n$). This makes it significantly more efficient to train.\n",

Tokens that are not named entities get given the null tag `O` and tokens that are named entities get one of four classes (`ORG`, `PER`, `LOC`, or `MISC`). Thus the sentence from earlier would be given the labels\n",

This is equivalent to having $L_{context}$ different classification heads, each trained to predict an output at a specific index. The $L_{context}$​ tokens are treated as a batch dimension, with the same transformation matrix applied to each token in our context window.

To help debug we have provided the handy `debug_macro_f1` function for you to use. This function generates random test cases and compares the output of your implementation to that of scikitlearn's.
