        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained model to accomplish a particular down-stream task. This is typically done by swapping out the pre-trained model's last layer (its head) for a new randomly initialized head and training both model and head.\n",

        "### **Model \"heads\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "The final output layer of a language model is typically called a \"head\". The standard head used by models when pre-training is called a \"language modeling head\". This is a dense linear layer that projects the $D_{enc}$ length encodings of each of the $L_{context}$ tokens to a probability distribution over the vocabulary. A single transformation matrix is learned and applied to all context tokens, which are treated as a batch dimension. The total size of this layer is thus ($D_{enc}$ x $|V|$).\n",

        "In Section 1 we used BERT's language modeling head to perform the Sentiment Analysis task. While we *can* train the model with its original LM head, this is unnecessary, as the LM head outputs probabilities over all tokens rather than just our targets. Thus, in this section we're going to remove the language modeling head and replace it with a classification head.\n",

        "A classification head is very similar to a language modeling head. It is a dense linear layer that projects the $D_{enc}$ length encodings of each of the $L_{context}$ tokens to a probability distribution over the *$n$ classes* rather than the whole vocabulary. The transformation matrix is again shared, with the context tokens treated as a batch dimension. The total size of this layer is thus ($D_{enc}$ x $n$).
