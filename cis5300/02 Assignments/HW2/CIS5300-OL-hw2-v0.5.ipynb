    "# Homework 2: Text Classification\n",
    "## Due Date: (TBD)\n",
    "## Total Points: (TBD)\n",
    "- **Overview**: For this assignment, we’ll be building a text classifier. The goal of our text classifer will be to distinguish between words that are simple and words that are complex. Example simple words are `heard`, `sat`, and `town`, and example complex words are `abdicate`, `detained`, and `vintners`. Distinguishing between simple and complex words is the first step in a larger NLP task called text simplification, which aims to replace complex words with simpler synonyms. Text simplification is potentially useful for re-writing texts so that they can be more easily understood by younger readers, people learning English as a second language, or people with learning disabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning goals**:\n",
    "    - Understand an important class of NLP evaluation methods (precision, recall and F1), and implement them yourself.\n",
    "    - Employ common experimental design practices in NLP. Split the annotated data into training/development/test sets, implement simple baselines to determine how difficult the task is, and experiment with a range of features and models.\n",
    "    - Get an introduction to `sklearn`, an excellent machine learning Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data**: We will provide you with training and development data that has been manually labeled. We will also give you a test set without labels. You will build a classifier to predict the labels on our test set. You can upload your classifier’s predictions to Gradescope. We will score its predictions and maintain a leaderboard showing whose classifier has the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "- **Delieverables:** This assignment has several deliverables:\n",
    "  - Code (this notebook) *(Automatic Graded)*\n",
    "    - rename to `homework2.ipynb` and `homework2.py`.\n",
    "  - Write Up (in a separate **writeup.pdf**) *(Manually Graded)*\n",
    "    - Answers to all questions labeled as `Answer #.#` in a file named `writeup.pdf`\n",
    "  - Leaderboard: Section 4 *(Automatic Graded on GradeScope)*\n",
    "    - Your best model’s output for the test set using only the provided training and development data (`test_labels.txt`)\n",
    "    - (Optional) your best model’s output for the test set, using any data that you want. (`test_labels.txt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grading**: We will use the auto-grading system called `PennGrader`. To complete the homework assignment, you should implement anything marked with `#TODO` or `##YOUR CODE HERE` and run the cell with `#PennGrader` note.\n",

Once you find the best threshold using the training data, use this same threshold for the development data as well.\n",

It is often useful to plot the Precision-Recall curve for various settings of the classifier to gauge its performance and compare it to other classifiers.

    "While the training data we have provided is sufficient for completing this assignment, it is not the only data for the task of identifying complex words. As an optional addition to this homework, you may look for and use any additional training data, and submit your predicted labels in a text file named `test_labels.txt` to the leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a start, we recommend looking at the [SemEval 2016 dataset](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task11/), a dataset that was used in a complex words identification competition. In addition, you can try to use data from [Newsela](https://newsela.com/). Newsela’s editors re-write newspaper articles to be appropriate for students at different grade levels. The company has generously shared a dataset with us. The Newsela data **may not** be re-distributed outside of Penn. You can find the data on eniac at `/home1/c/ccb/data/newsela/newsela_article_corpus_with_scripts_2016-01-29.1.zip`.\n",
