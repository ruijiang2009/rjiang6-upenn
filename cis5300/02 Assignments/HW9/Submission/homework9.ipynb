        "**Background:** Text simplification is the process of converting complex sentences into simple ones that are still faithful to the originl meaning. It can be used in cases where a complex document needs to be translated into a simpler form for a particular audience, like children, non-native speakers, and people who face reading difficulties. Even computational tasks like machine translation and text summarization can benefit from simplifying text first.\n",

        "Over the years, research on text simplification has evolved from simple, rule-based approaches like substituting complex words with simpler ones, or splitting long sentences into more easily understandable shorter ones, to more complex methods that leverage large language models to understand complex pieces of information and generate simpler versions.\n",

Researchers focused on three levels of the cave that Neanderthals used roughly 45,000 years ago.\\n\\nRiel-Salvatore and his colleagues wrote that the cave was probably used at times as a permanent residence, and as a logistical base at other times. It's for this latter use that researchers noticed the greatest organization.\\n\\nSpecifically, researchers found evidence of fire building, or \\\"hearths\\\" toward the rear wall of the cave, while stone tools and chips, as well as animal materials, were found outside the cave.\\n\\n\\\"This may suggest an effort to keep activities associated with the production of noxious debris segregated from those parts of the shelter that were more enclosed and that, possibly, were associated with activities such as sleeping and socializing next to hearths,\\\" authors wrote.\\n\\nResearchers cautioned that their conclusions were made on a roughly 15-square-foot preliminary excavation, and that further work was necessary to confirm their observations.\\n\\nAmong other findings, the researchers noted the presence of edible shellfish remains throughout the cave dwelling, as well as large amounts of ochre. Study authors said they were unclear as to what the ochre was used for, but speculated that it may have been used during animal butchering or in processing animal hides.\\n\\n\\\"Neanderthals could have used it for tanning hides, for gluing, as an antiseptic or even for symbolic purposes,\\\" Riel Salvatore said of the ochre. \\\"We really can't tell at this point.\\\"\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Until recently Neanderthals were considered uncivilized creatures and were believed to have lived in disorderly conditions.

        "In this homework, we thought about how we would approach this task as humans, how we can measure simplicitly programmatically, and we even tried to think of and implement some logic to simplify a sentence. We then explored how we can use large language models to perform this task, both by instructing them explicitly, simply just giving them examples of what we expect, and putting both approaches together. Finally, we evaluated how well each of these approaches did in order to gain insight into the best way to solve this problem.\n",
