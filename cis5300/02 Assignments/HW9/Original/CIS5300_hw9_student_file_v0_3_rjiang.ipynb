        "**Background:** Text simplification is the process of converting complex sentences into simple ones that are still faithful to the originl meaning. It can be used in cases where a complex document needs to be translated into a simpler form for a particular audience, like children, non-native speakers, and people who face reading difficulties. Even computational tasks like machine translation and text summarization can benefit from simplifying text first.\n",

        "Over the years, research on text simplification has evolved from simple, rule-based approaches like substituting complex words with simpler ones, or splitting long sentences into more easily understandable shorter ones, to more complex methods that leverage large language models to understand complex pieces of information and generate simpler versions.\n",

We then explored how we can use large language models to perform this task, both by instructing them explicitly, simply just giving them examples of what we expect, and putting both approaches together. Finally, we evaluated how well each of these approaches did in order to gain insight into the best way to solve this problem.\n",
