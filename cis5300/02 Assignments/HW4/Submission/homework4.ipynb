        "- **Overview**: In this assignment you will implement many of the things you learned in [Chapter 6 of the textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf). If you haven't read it yet, now would be a good time to do that.  We'll wait.  Done?  Great, let's move on.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    We will provide a corpus of Shakespeare plays, which you will use to create a term-document matrix and a term-context matrix. You'll implement a selection of the weighting methods and similarity metrics defined in the textbook. Ultimately, your goal is to use the resulting vectors to measure how similar Shakespeare plays are to each other, and to find words that are used in a similar fashion. All (or almost all) of the code you write will be direct implementations of concepts and equations described in [Chapter 6, sections 6.3-6.7](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf).\n",

        "    - Write Up (include this in a separate report.pdf) (Manually Graded)\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Grading**: We will use the auto-grading system called `PennGrader`. To complete the homework assignment, you should implement anything marked with `#TODO` and run the cell with `#PennGrader` note. **There will be no hidden tests in this assignment.** In other words, you will know your score once you finish all the `#TODO` and run all the `#PennGrader` tests!\n",

        "- When finding the top 10 similar items for a given target element, should I count the target element?  \n",

        "\n",
        "- How can I represent a character as a vector for calculating similarity?  \n",
        "    *One reasonable way would be to do it much in the same way as for plays. You would just need to write code to segment out each character as the given code did for each play.*\n",
        "\n",
        "- What kind of analysis can I perform on the female and male Shakespearean characters for the report?  \n",
        "    *There can be various ways to go about this. You can look at PCA projections of the vectors representing the characters in the plays to see if the men and women cluster in distinct areas that are demarcated. Or you can look at the similarity scores among women, among men and compare it to the similarity scores between men and men to see if it is significantly different. To account for outliers, you can use averages in this case. Feel free to play around with different vector representations and different similarity measures.*\n",
        "\n",
        "- How can I improve the performance and efficiency of my code?  \n",

        "\n",
        "A vector space is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science that provides a way to represent and manipulate objects that have both magnitude and direction. In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), we use vector spaces to represent words, documents, or other entities as points in a high-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectors:\n",
        "A vector is an object that has both magnitude (length) and direction.\n",
        "In NLP, we often represent words or documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dimensions:\n",
        "The dimensions of a vector space correspond to the features or characteristics that we use to describe the objects.\n",
        "For example, in a term-document matrix, each dimension could represent the frequency of a specific word in a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vector Representation:\n",
        "Each word or document can be represented as a point (vector) in this high-dimensional space.\n",
        "The position of the point is determined by the values of its features (e.g., word frequencies).\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarity and Distance:\n",
        "The similarity between vectors can be measured using various metrics, such as cosine similarity.\n",
        "Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a way to quantify how similar two words or documents are based on their context or content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applications:\n",
        "By representing words and documents as vectors, we can perform various analyses, such as finding similar words, clustering documents, or detecting anomalies.\n",

        "    In your code you will write a function to `create_term_document_matrix`.  This will let you be the hit of your next dinner party by being able to answer trivia questions like *how many words did Shakespeare use?*, which may give us a hint to the answer to *How many words did Shakespeare know?*  The table will also tell you how many words Shakespeare used only once.  Did you know that there's a technical term for that?  In corpus linguistics they are called [*hapax legomena*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon), but I prefer the term *singleton*, because I don't like snooty Greek or Latin terms.\n"

        "Quantifying the goodness of one vector space representation over another can be very difficult to do.  It might ultimately require testing how the different vector representations change the performance when used in a downstream task like question answering. A common way of quantifying the goodness of word vectors is to use them to compare the similarity of words with human similarity judgments, and then calculate the correlation of the two rankings.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you would like extra credit on this assignment, you can quantify the goodness of each of the different vector space models that you produced (for instance by varying the size of the context window, picking PPMI or tf-idf, and selecting among cosine, Jaccard, and Dice).  You can calculate their scores on the [SimLex999 data set](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fh295/simlex.html), and compute their correlation with human judgments using [Kendall's Tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient).\n",
