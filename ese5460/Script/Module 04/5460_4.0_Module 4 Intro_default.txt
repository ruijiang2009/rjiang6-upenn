[MUSIC PLAYING] Typical data sets consist of images, sentences, sounds of different kinds. And there are spatial regularities in such data. The picture of a blue car has a bunch of pixels colored blue. The words of a sentence are often related to each other as to what topic they correspond to. The sounds that a songbird makes to attract its mate follow a certain tune. 

Convolutional neural networks, CNNs for short, are neural networks that allow us to capture such regularities in the input data. A fully connected network uses matrix multiplication as the canonical operator in each layer. A convolutional network uses a convolution operation as the canonical operation. This is an operation that is designed to capture the regularities in the data. 

Most modern deep networks are convolutional neural networks. We will study the many variants of a CNN. We will see how to get translational equivariance in these networks. Due to this, the network can classify a cat irrespective of whether it is showing up in the top-right corner of the image or the bottom-left corner of the image. This is what makes CNNs powerful.
